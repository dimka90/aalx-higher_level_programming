## Introduction

Input and output (I/O) are fundamental concepts in programming. Python provides several built-in functions and methods to handle I/O effectively. This project aims to help you understand and utilize these capabilities for various I/O operations in Python.

## Getting Started

To use the examples and code in this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once Python is installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine or simply copy the code examples into your Python development environment.

## Input Operations

### Reading from the Keyboard

Python provides the `input()` function to read user input from the keyboard. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
user_input = input("Enter something: ")
print("You entered:", user_input)
```

### Reading from Files

You can read data from files in Python using various file-handling techniques. Common methods include `open()`, `read()`, and `readlines()`. Example:

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("File content:\n", content)
```

## Output Operations

### Printing to the Screen

The `print()` function is used to display output on the screen. It can display text, variables, and expressions. Example:

```python
name = "Alice"
print("Hello,", name)
```

### Writing to Files

To write data to files, you can use the `open()` function with the appropriate mode ('w' for write, 'a' for append). Example:

```python
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is a sample text.")
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains practical examples of input and output operations in Python. You can run these scripts to see the concepts in action.
