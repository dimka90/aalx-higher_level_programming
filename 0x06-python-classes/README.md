## Introduction

Welcome to the "Python - Classes and Objects" guide (Version 0x06). This guide is designed to help you understand the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid grasp of classes, objects, attributes, methods, inheritance, encapsulation, and more.

## Classes and Objects

In Python, a class serves as a blueprint for creating objects. An object represents a specific instance of a class. Classes provide the structure and behavior that define the characteristics of objects, making it possible to model real-world entities in your code.

## Defining a Class

To define a class in Python, you utilize the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. Within the class body, you can define attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that collectively determine the class's properties and behaviors.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, parameter1, parameter2):
        self.parameter1 = parameter1
        self.parameter2 = parameter2
    
    def my_method(self):
        # Method code here
