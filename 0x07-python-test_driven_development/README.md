## About

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. This project is designed to help you understand and practice TDD principles in Python.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

- Python 3.7+
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dimka90/alx-higher_level_programming/0x07-python-test_driven_development
2. change to the project repository

   ```bash
    cd alx-higher_level_progrmaing/0x07-python-test_driven_development
3. Usage
This project includes various exercises and tasks related to TDD in Python. Each task has its own directory with test files and Python modules. You can navigate to each task's directory and run the tests to practice TDD.

For example, to run the tests for the "0-add_integer" task:
  python -m doctest -v 0-add_integer.py

### Contributing
